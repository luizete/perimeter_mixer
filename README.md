# Perimeter Mixer
Get better prints with mixed perimeters order! Use internal perimeters first only when necessary.

## Theory
Generally, enabling the option External Perimeter First on SuperSlicer grants better external layers quality and layer stacking consistency on some prints. However, enabling it may interfere with overhangs. Thus, by printing layers without overhangs with this option enabled, we grant a better print without countersides.
